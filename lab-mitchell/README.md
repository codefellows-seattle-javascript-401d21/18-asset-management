# Lab 18 ~ Bearer Authorization

**Author**: Mitchell
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This lab is focused on utilizing AWS (Amazon Web Services) and their S3 service (cloud file storage/hosting). We need to incorporate new middleware to convert images to a readable stream and send that to S3 for storage. On success, S3 will return data about the stored file, and we need to store that information and a URI reference to the stored image in MongoDB. We need to add a new `route-photo.js` to the `route/` directory

## Getting Started
To get this application up and running, fork and/or clone this repository using the `git clone <git repository link>` command in your terminal. Next, run the `npm install` command, which will install all the necessary dependencies in the accompanying package.json file. After those packages have installed, you can run `npm test` to explore the included tests and functionality of their respective solutions. You can open up the code in your favorite editor to explore/modify the code, see how the tests are structured, and create tests of your own if desired.
